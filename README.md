# Cave Runner

A 7-day ramake of the first game project I ever made (circa mid-2010's). The compiled game can be [played online or downloaded on itch.io](https://supergobo.itch.io/cave-runner).

Other than finishing in 7 days, I had two goals for this project:
1. Make this game deployable for Android phones
2. Make the graphics/animations cooler than my original version

I can confidently say that I achieved both of these goals despite the game lacking a significant amount of polish (i.e. the character simply disappears when hitting an obstacle).
